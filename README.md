# ReactJS-Components
Created with CodeSandbox
Elements in react JS can be treated as separate components.  For example, a web page consisting of a list and a heading can be assumed to be consisting of a list component and a heading component.   So basically the working of components in reactJS is like for a list there will be a separate file called list.jsx whereas for the heading there will be a separate file in the same directory called headings.jsx .  Each of these files will have a function written in JavaScript that will return the respective items that is in case of list.jsx it will return a list of items whereas in the case of heading.jsx it will just contain the heading.  In the index.jsx file the ReactDOM.render will just contain a main file that is called the app with the opening and closing angular brackets as shown in the code , the app.jsx file will basically import the list.j6 and the heading.jsx as shown in the code and the main index.jsx files will import the app.jsx file along with react and  ReactDom . 

Note:    In case of the creation of files, let's say in the above example list.jsx, app.jsx, and  heading.jsx the L in the list H  in the heading, and 'a' in the app.jsx should be capitalized this applies to all the other examples as well
